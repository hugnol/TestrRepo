# Dobot Maigician with Python - Starter Guide

The [DoBot Magician](https://www.dobot.cc/dobot-magician/product-overview.html) is a fun mechanical arm with alot of functionallity. Thanks to the large array of peripherals available it can do many tasks if operated correctly. The main means of controling the DoBot Magician is the [Magician Studio](https://www.dobot.cc/downloadcenter/dobot-magician.html#most-download) application and it is easy to use for people of any age. 

This guide will not focus on how to operate the DoBot Magician through the Magician Studio, but instead through Python. Using your own code to control the DoBot Magician opens up for much more freedom, allowing things like automation and very calibrated movements for intricate tasks.

## Starting Out

To get started you'll need an IDE which you can use to work with Python. There is no need to use a specific one so go with the IDE that you are the most comfortable with and has support for Python. For the functions created in this guide [Atom](https://atom.io/) was used, but it is not necessary.

You will also need an installed copy of Python.
